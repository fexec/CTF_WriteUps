## Level 00

Level 00 asks to find an SUID file that will run as the "flag00" user.

This level can be solved in just a few commands.

First you must login as the "level00" user.

Next, we'll use the find command to find SUID files.

```
find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```
Let's break down the command:
**-perm **  -  this allows us to search for a specific permission in files.
**-u**  -  allows us to search for "user" permissions as opposed to "group" or "other" permissions denoted by "-g" and "-o", respectively.

**s**  -  In this case we want the SUID bit, defined by "s". 

**2>/dev/null**  -  The find command has a very noisy output and will also print failed attempts. 
                    This allows you to filter out errors and keep a clean sheet with only successful results.

The head command helps us display only the first few results, for proof of concept.

Navigating to the file allows us to execute the file and use getflag to get the hypothetical flag.
